The project will create a city which is procedurally generated. The user is able to drive around the city in various vehicles. There are different types of cities that the person is able to go to. Each one with a unique theme, and a unique vehicle. To visit these different cities, the user will change the song that is playing on the radio in their vehicle. The city themes could be a WW2 setting, a city which is celebrating new years, a hot summer etc etc. There will be anywhere from 2-5 cities that the user can traverse to enjoy the music and most importantly, admire the setting.
